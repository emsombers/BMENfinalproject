The EmoFilm dataset is massive so we will only download the relevant preprocessed, denoised fMRI files 

To download only the relevant files, run 
    bash get_fmri_files.sh

Note this will take a long time! Leave a few hours for this step.  

And then you can run in the Preprocessing the folder creation so it matches the file path in other parts of the code.
